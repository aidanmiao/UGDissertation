Files used for my dissertation project.
These are the CSV files used for the data analysis section of my Undergraduate Dissertation.

The main data used for analysis is labelled "Analysis Data.csv" above. It is used to create the regression models. 

"policy.csv" contains the lockdown policy's stringency levels, collected from Oxford University's published data source: https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy. It recorded the policy variations for each US state (plus Washington DC) during the seven survey periods. It also has a column indicating new Covid-19 cases and deaths for each survey period. 

"us.csv" contains the cumulative Covid-19 cases and deaths for the entire US since 21st Jan, 2020, until 10th April, 2022. A column of daily new Covid-19 cases is also included. The source of the data is from New York Time's published repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.

The results of my dissertation can also be replicated using the R code provided in this repository.
